Hacker Terminal

Create a hacker terminal with a custom theme. You are free to implement any UI-style that you like.

The terminal should be able to execute the following commands:
- list
- connect
- engage

list
Lists all the supported commands..

connect
Shows a fancy progress bar that imitates connecting to a remote server (only UI).

engage
Transforms the terminal into a Matrix-inspired display where symbols are raining from the top of the screen in different colors.

Feel free to add other commands to make your terminal more interactive and fun!
